## List of features to code

- [ ] a function to enter numbers in the grid
- [ ] we can call it input() or enter() as you want : you are free
- [ ] a function which checks that a row and / or a column is correct : the function could have in argument the element furthest to the left of a row or of a column and the direction HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL to be checked
  - [ ] a function that checks that a row is correct
  - [ ] a function that checks that a column is correct
- [ ] a function that checks a region: the 3x3 square
- [ ] a function that checks the entire grid
- [ ] the main function which initializes a grid, removes 4 or 5 elements and allows the player to play until he has won (we could put a life system in place with a maximum number of faults before the end of the game)
