## Genesis

The idea of creating this project is multiple :

- first of all, I wanted to contribute to the Hacktoberfest event and to propose a project
- this project allows you to discover the C language simply
- the functional breakdown is there to adapt to any level
- learning to code by making a little game is always fun
- there are many prospects for development: create and code the same game but with a graphic display

## Language

Why did you choose the C language ? :

- this allows beginners to learn this very popular and very powerful language
- this allows the project to be broken down into different functionalities and different functions
- I like the C language
